We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
