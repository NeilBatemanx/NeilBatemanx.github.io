<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
