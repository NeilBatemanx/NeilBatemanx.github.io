Fortunately, a surveillance camera can lend an extra pair of eyes and function as lookout for you and your family.

<p>You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm.

In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten trespassers most of the times. To hold and recover expenses alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to necessitate authorities reaction.</p>
