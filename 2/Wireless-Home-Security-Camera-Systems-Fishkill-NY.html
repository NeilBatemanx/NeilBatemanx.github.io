<p>If you're trying to find motion detection, the Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends informs straight to your phone. This camera offers a wide range of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road. Not great, not horrible, but with an actually simple setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer feature when it pertains to wise cameras.) This newer variation is much the same, to be frank.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you remain in a conference with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get informed up until the next day?
