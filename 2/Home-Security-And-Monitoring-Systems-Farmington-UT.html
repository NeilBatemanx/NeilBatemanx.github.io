With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
