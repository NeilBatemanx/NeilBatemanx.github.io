<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop.

It also indicates that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your smart device, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you picture, would suffice to send even the most committed profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
