<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic choice for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>

Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>Every wireless home security system includes a variety of Entry Sensors. The magnetic sensing units are quickly installed on doors, windows, and other entry points.
