<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more costly for the exact same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy choice. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year agreement, but because Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So choose what will be the better deal for you. If you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years, go with the contract and reap those savings. But if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
