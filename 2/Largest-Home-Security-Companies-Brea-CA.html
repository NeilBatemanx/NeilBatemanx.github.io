<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the essentials. However while ADT systems deal with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems don't.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
