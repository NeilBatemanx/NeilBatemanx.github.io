<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for example, a top-ranking cops official in Washington, DC was caught utilizing police databases to gather information on clients of a gay club.

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>

The big 3 smarthome hubs (Alexa, Assistant, and Siri) will connect simply great with SimpliSafe, however, not all third-party devices will link.</p>
