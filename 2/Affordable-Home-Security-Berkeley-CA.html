The LED light will turn on and the warning tone will sound through the camera's 85 db speakers if a lurker is identified on your property by the camera. Just like a lot of cameras, you'll get activity notifications with the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro.</p>

You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it hardly ever sends incorrect notifies since it tracks your phone (and other member of the family's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns whatever off. Similarly, it will arm itself immediately when everyone has actually left.</p>
