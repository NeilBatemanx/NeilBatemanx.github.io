<p>That's to say, a PTZ camera has a much larger field of view with usually 90 ° tilt and 360 ° pan, and can see far-away objects plainly by zooming in, like the plate number 40 feet away.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.
