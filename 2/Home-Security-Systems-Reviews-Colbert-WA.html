<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why a lot of people are selecting this alternative. </p>
