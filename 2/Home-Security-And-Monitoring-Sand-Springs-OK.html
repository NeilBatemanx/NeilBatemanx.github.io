<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.
