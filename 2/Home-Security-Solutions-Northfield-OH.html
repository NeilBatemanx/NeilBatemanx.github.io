<p>Numerous other designs were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
