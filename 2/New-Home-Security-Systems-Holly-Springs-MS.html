<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set quantity of time, normally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as many times as you want.</p>

When our burglar alarms are set off, we can contact emergency situation response services if your home or family are in danger.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
