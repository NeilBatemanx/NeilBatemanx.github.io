A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting tiny distinctions in temperature.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
