The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide attackers are clearly not deterred by camera - and may even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system might provide in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
