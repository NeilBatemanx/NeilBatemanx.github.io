<p>Failed authorizations must lead to an alarm or at least a timed lockout to prevent experimenting with possible codes.  Some systems can be configured to permit deactivation of private sensors or groups.  High-end systems permit numerous access codes, and might even allow them to be utilized just as soon as, or on particular days, or just in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied).

Similar to gain access to codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, say, for heating system repairperson to enter the kitchen and basement sensor areas but not the silver vault in the kitchen. There are likewise systems that permit a pressure code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still trigger the remote alarm to summon the police to a robbery.</p>
