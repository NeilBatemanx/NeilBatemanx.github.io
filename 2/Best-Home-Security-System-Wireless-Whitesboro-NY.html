<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will love.

Over my 25 plus year career in the security market, I have looked into, sold, set up, and since we have our own central station at American Alarm Systems, watched alarm signals for more hours than I want to admit.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
