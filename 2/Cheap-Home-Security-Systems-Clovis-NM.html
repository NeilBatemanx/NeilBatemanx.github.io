<p>The other major decision when choosing a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera.

Most companies provide property owners the ability to add extra elements like another camera, contact sensing units, a panic button, keypad, smoke alarm, carbon monoxide gas detectors, or a crucial fob.</p>
<p>Compression: Compression is utilized to get rid of unneeded information from the footage transferred to your video recorder, thereby saving space. Two of the more common compression methods utilized for high-definition video are MJPEG and H. 264. You can likewise utilize MPEG4, however the quality tends to be lower than that of MPEG4's previously mentioned counterparts.

Considering that carbon monoxide is colorless and odor-free, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector. Fortunately, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the quantity of CO in your home increases to a dangerous level. With a wireless system, you can also get push notices on your phone or tablet that let you know there is a problem, even when you're not in your home.</p>

Window sensing units don't protect against someone smashing through large glass windows or sliding glass doors and strolling through it. Glass break detectors, on the other hand, recognize the sounds produced by breaking glass and alert your home security company.</p>
<p>Among the challenges clever alarm systems present to the customer is the danger of being hacked. Incorrect home network configurations, defects in the gadgets or password compromise might allow a hacker to break into the system and determine if anybody is home, or even seize control.
