<p>The Residence Smart Security Kit, our previous runner-up, is still a strong option for some individuals. Abode has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a better variety for sensing units. Both the original Residence system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only design we evaluated that likewise works with HomeKit. We've come across a few technical issues while long-lasting testing the Abode Iota, therefore will continue to test and update accordingly. We no longer recommend it.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
