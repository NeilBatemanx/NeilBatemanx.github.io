<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrician (who happens to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We have actually examined numerous essential reasons one ought to think about commercial-grade cameras up until now, however, we have actually simply skimmed the surface area of the topic. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is hardly ever a stand-alone system. It deserves knowing if your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products. </p>
