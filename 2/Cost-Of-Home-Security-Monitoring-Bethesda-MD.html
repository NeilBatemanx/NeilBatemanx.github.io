<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view.

If a nefarious criminal was quickly enough, they could surpass the camera before it had time to tape them.</p>

The second is that frequently, home security systems are coupled with service setups in your home that consist of maintenance agreements.
