In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be applied rather to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services. You will not get a money or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law, return a sum equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any quantities due on your account (consisting of, without constraint, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, modified or not returned).</p>

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
