The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you wish to conserve some money - it does have a cable television connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit much easier to undermine for possible burglars. Definitely one of the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
