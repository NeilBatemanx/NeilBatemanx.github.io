The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the higher end, some agreements could cover approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would advise considering a Do It Yourself home security system rather if you want to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
<p>The primary reasons to go with a professional monitoring service are the increased security of having a live individual examining if the alarm isn't turned off within a particular amount of time, and contacting the police to do a well-being and come check if there isn't an answer, or a distress code is given. With alarm monitoring, Jacksonville households can sleep much easier at night or while away from home.</p>
