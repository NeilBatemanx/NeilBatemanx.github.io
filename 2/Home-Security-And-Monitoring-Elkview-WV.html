<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific very same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
