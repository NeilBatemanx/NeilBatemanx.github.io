<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
