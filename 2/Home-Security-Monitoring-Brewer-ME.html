<p>Nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensing unit that will set off the camera to tape video when motion is discovered. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is occurring, and some will also generate an email alert. For an extra layer of security, look for a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if someone is out there even if they run out series of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit.

<h2>Wired Or Wireless Video Surveillance, What's The Difference Brewer</h2>
<p>Brinks is a solid option for basic home security that includes well-regarded expert monitoring, but if you're searching for home automation, it doesn't have much to provide beyond Nest's equipment.

The panel and sensing units are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so overall a good deal. In-home assessments are sales opportunities for security companies. These assessments can be super handy, however they can also sell you on a bunch of equipment you didn't believe you required (and most likely still do not).</p>

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, however the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for instance, are compatible with the IP cameras just from specific producers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you need to initially make sure that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually purchased. The cameras must be able to provide you with the needed information if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
