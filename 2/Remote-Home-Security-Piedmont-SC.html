<p>There's no use in having an outdoor security camera if you can't recognize who or what the camera is looking at. A camera that records video at 720p will usually provide a fairly sharp photo, however 1080p video provides more information and is the most popular resolution for these devices; it does not need great deals of storage capacity and can be viewed on nearly all pcs, tablets, and phones.</p>

However one benefit of ordering your camera as part of a whole-home security system is that you don't need to worry as much about the details of each specific camera-- you can take advantage of the competence of the home security company for aid selecting the best cameras to secure your home.</p>
