<p>Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The wide face of the camera gives you an impressive field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer system.</p>
<p>Wired systems use permanence and higher reliability, while wireless systems offer a high level of customization and the ease of mobility.
