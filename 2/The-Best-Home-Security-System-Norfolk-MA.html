<p>Since it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

But there's a plus side: Once you enter the agreement, Protect America offers the important home security equipment free of charge without additional upfront costs. You're just responsible for the monthly monitoring cost and any optional upgrades. There's also a rate match warranty.</p>
