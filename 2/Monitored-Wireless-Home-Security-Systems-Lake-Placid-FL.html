In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security guard. A number of cities also need a license to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
