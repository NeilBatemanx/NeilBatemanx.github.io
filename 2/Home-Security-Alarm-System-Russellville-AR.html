We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>

<p>Many full-time" homeowners with alarm systems inform us that they are home all the time" and wonder why they would need monitoring. However, people need to consider the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - instead of just their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not?
