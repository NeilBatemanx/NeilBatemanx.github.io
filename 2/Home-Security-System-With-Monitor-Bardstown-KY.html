It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you've labeled (after a learning period).

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that information when they appear at your home.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
