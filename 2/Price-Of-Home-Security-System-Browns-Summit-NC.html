<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
