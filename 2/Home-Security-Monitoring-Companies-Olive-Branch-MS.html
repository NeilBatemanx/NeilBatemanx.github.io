<p>Perhaps this is no better showed than via Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's remarks, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had actually changed because he took on the function in 2014, with the growth of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and a lot more. Modern systems now have sensational abilities", though these have produced reasonable misgivings about the danger for privacy and prospective abuse such capabilities produce.
