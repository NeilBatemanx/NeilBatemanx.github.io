<p>When triggered, burglar alarms most commonly do 7 main jobs. The first job is the alert of a siren, this allows for everybody in your neighborhood including the property owners or business owners to know that an intruder has been detected. The second task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights however the most common alarm system and a few of the more advanced ones do.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>We have evaluated numerous important reasons one should consider commercial-grade cameras up until now, however, we have simply skimmed the surface area of the topic.
