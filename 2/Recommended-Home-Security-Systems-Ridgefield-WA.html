<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a variety of features consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I evaluated a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the road. Not fantastic, not horrible, however with a really easy setup process (and trust me, that actually is a killer function when it comes to wise cameras.) This more recent version is similar, to be frank.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; everything within their focus capability is recorded. That is to say, CCTV cameras are quite un-focused when it pertains to separating the images of an active incident about to occur. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to add to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
