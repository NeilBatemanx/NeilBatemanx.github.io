<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Actually annoying. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to up to 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a function available from all companies. Be sure to look into the company's functions or speak with a representative straight if this is a high top priority.
