You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should instantly understand.</p>

<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera in Elma WA</h3>
<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate instead of buying a self-monitored security system.

<p>I described that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, which camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the threat and, if required, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>There is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. The amount and quality of information stored on storage media goes through compression ratios, images kept per 2nd, image size and is effected by the retention period of the images or videos. 123 DVRs store images in a range of exclusive file formats Recordings may be retained for a preset amount of time and then immediately archived, overwritten or erased, the period being determined by the organisation that produced them.</p>

For starters, Deep Knowing enables someone to discover what they are trying to find without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Think of a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the aspects you are trying to find in the taped video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful service for collecting and catching crooks evidence.</p>

After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for example.</p>
