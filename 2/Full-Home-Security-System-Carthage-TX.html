<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
