<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
