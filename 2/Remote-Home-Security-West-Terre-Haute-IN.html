<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can compare general motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
