We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
