<p>Nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. But suicide opponents are clearly not hindered by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can ensure - and the expense of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system may supply in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
