<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. In a network injection attack, a hacker can utilize gain access to points that are exposed to non-filtered network traffic, specifically relaying network traffic such as Spanning Tree" (802.1 D), OSPF, RIP, and HSRP The hacker injects phony networking re-configuration commands that affect routers, switches, and smart hubs. A whole network can be reduced in this way and require rebooting or even reprogramming of all smart networking devices.</p>
<p>When motion is identified, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to tape video. The sensing unit can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will also create an email alert. For an additional layer of security, look for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they're out of variety of the camera lens and the motion sensor. Fair caution: You'll most likely have to fine-tune the sound level of sensitivity settings to avoid alerts from barking pets, loud automobiles, and other random noises.</p>

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic choice for long variety scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
