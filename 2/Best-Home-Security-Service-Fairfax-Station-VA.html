<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice.

So select what will be the much better deal for you. If you understand you'll sit tight for at least 3 years, choose the contract and gain those savings. However if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
