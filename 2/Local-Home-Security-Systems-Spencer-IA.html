You can, however, utilize Alexa to equip or disarm the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to save energy based upon when you're home or away. However these integrations aren't rather as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things plainly.</p>
