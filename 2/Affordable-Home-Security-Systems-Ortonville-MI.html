<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a malicious assailant, because the disruption of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transferred. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing an opportunity for the malicious assaulter to record these codes and use different splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured during the network healing.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
