For the ones that do not, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is taped.

This alternative is generally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative saves your video clips in the cloud. However, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend on just how much cloud storage you want to spend for.</p>
