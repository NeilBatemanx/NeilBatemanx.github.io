<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses extra info that may never ever have been possible previously, such as alert of a worker, by name and identification number, entering the building.
