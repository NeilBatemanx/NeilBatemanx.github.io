<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

If an expertly installed security system from alarm companies or Brinks Home Security seem like overkill, then you can save a great deal of money by buying a system that you install yourself.
