<p>SimpliSafe equipment covers the basics. However while ADT systems work with Z-Wave devices, SimpliSafe systems do not. This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home devices like lights, outlets, thermostats, and locks.

<p>Siren A number of one-box systems like Canary and Somfy come with a very loud built-in siren that must ideally scare off intruders (or next door's feline).

With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that higher rate features a system that is smaller, much faster, and more powerful.
