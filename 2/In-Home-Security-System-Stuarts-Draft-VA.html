<p>This is the best-scoring smart alarm we tested.

The instructions are very thorough and the 200m series of the alarm means it can be used to secure sheds and garages in addition to your home.

<p>Frontpoint offers 5 packages and 2 monitoring plans: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester opted for the Interactive plan but wound up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance.

It ended up being a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
