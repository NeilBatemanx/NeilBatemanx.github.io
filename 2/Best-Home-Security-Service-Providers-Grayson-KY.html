<h2>What Does Battery Life Have To Do With Security Cameras Grayson</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering several decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the highly advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today.

Improper home network configurations, defects in the devices or password compromise might enable a hacker to burglarize the system and figure out if anyone is home, or perhaps take control. Though keeping the huge quantity of information can be a concern, it's not unusual for IP CCTV systems to have software that governs how long the video is stored, and at what quality.
