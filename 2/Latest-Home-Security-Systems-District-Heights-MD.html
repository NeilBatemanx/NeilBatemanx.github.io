<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. If capturing video in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

And to be truthful, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the first location. What you're spending for is mainly that big name in blue. </p>
