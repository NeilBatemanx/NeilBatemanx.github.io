Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
