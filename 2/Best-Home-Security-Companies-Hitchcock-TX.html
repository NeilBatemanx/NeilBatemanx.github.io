<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>Video recording isn't a basic alternative on a lot of security systems. Homeowners searching for a system that offers video recording need to make sure the option is readily available rather than presume it is. Storing video is also a concern. Video files are big, which means a great deal of area is needed. There are a handful of companies that use totally free video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and just kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a month-to-month storage fee.</p>
