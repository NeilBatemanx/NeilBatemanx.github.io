A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that can finding tiny differences in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and develops an electronic image based on information about the temperature distinctions.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
