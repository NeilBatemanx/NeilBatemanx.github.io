<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to performance issues. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store.

Which, you think of, would be enough to send out even the most committed career criminal scampering empty-handed down the road. </p>
