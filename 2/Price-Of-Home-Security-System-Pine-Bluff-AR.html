<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same method as public cameras? We also require to draw great lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one!
