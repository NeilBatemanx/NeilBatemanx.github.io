If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by a neighborhood cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly.
