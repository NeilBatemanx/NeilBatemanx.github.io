The Ring Stick Up Webcam comes in wired and battery variations, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. However neither can tape continuously, and they both require the Ring Protect plan to catch recordings. Likewise, the wired variation normally left spaces of approximately 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery variation left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise lack person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize incorrect alerts.</p>
