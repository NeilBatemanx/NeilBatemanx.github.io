For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.

The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as various third-party smart- home gadgets.
