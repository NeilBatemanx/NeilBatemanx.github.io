<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He supplied the recommendations regarding what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek got here and managed the installation right on time. He consulted with us concerning placement of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in packing the app and completing the online set-up process. He also evaluated the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were really expert and handy. Thanks.</p>
<p>The first thing I take a look at in a security system are its system elements. Home security market is attempting to use new gadgets and innovation is progressing. Now, many security systems involve a multitude of elements, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and essential fobs, among other components. But I also value minimalist systems that parts that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation offered to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I wish to make certain that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

<p>One of the challenges smart alarm systems pose to the customer is the risk of being hacked. Incorrect home network setups, flaws in the gadgets or password compromise could allow a hacker to get into the system and determine if anyone is home, and even seize control. Though keeping the huge quantity of information can be a concern, it's not uncommon for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs for how long the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to save storage space, for instance.</p>
