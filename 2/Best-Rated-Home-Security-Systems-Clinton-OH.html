At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten burglars most of the times.

I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
