But I also value minimalist systems that parts that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, wise lock, etc.), I want to make sure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
