<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
