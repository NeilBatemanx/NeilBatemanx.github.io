<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you specifically redirect the field of vision without remounting the security camera every time. They're great for warehouses. Some of these may resemble dome cameras, however there's an easy trick to distinguish them - if the lens and the IR LEDs remain in front of the glass on the housing rather than contained behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In fact, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to distinguish between an automobile and a person, for instance, enables you to cut down on unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
