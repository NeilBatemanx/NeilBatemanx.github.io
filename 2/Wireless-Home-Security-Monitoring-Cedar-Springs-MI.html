<p>Having family pets indicates you will require to consider their size, movements, and any other aspects that might cause issues. For instance, if you have animals that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensors can be adjusted or a system that can be set up in such a way that your big pets will not cause incorrect alarms to be sent each time your family pet moves.
