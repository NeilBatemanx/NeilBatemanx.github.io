While the cameras get the majority of the attention in the start, you also have other concerns, such as watching, recording, and archiving the video footage, and the equipment needed for carrying out those tasks. Here's a look at the basic parts of a normal CCTV system. Must have access to wi-fi. Without access to a wireless network, the wireless system isn't going to work. So, having access to wi-fi is a need to if you desire a wireless system with remote access.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based upon available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
