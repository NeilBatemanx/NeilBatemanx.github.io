<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set quantity of time, generally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement.

<p>Committing to getting a wireless home security system can be a wonderful alternative. It's a simple method to deter crooks. They also have a number of advantages. Most towns and cities need an alarm license if you register for a monitoring service. Some even need a license if you're installing a local alarm that does not call the authorities.

<p>So what occurs if something triggers your alarm however you remain in a conference with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service means you don't get signaled till the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the sound may scare off would-be trespassers-- if you're fortunate. But the cops won't come until you personally call them. </p>
