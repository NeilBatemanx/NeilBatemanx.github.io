<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
