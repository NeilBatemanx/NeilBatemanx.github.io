<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>

If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the sound might frighten prospective burglars-- if you're lucky. However the cops will not come till you personally call them. </p>
