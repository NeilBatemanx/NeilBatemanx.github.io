House has updated that version with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a better range for sensors. Both the original Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that likewise deals with HomeKit.

Some models utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others need that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as getting in touch with property owners, alerting police, or dispatching private security forces.

<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the person being viewed know they're being seen, and you can select to record video or images and conserve them to your smart gadget on a whim. </p>
