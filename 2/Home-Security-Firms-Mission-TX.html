The recorder has 2 jobs- taping the caught video and being a standalone wifi network.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long range scenarios where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>Think about it in this manner, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more sophisticated camera be cost the low cost of forty dollars? It simply does not accumulate. To offer such low prices, makers need to cut corners, and the end outcome is jeopardized performance. What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in perfect conditions like brilliant sunshine? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in specific circumstances such as nanny webcams or signing in on a pet, though when aiming to collect proof of a criminal offense they often come up short.</p>
