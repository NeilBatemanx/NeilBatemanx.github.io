<p>You can activate the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency. I am somewhat disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to be enough to scare away burglars in most cases.

<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you may want to explore hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases fitted into daily items such as clocks, smoke alarm, and magnets. If you require to document a crucial meeting in a public place, a personal hidden camera built into a watch or pen might be a good choice.
