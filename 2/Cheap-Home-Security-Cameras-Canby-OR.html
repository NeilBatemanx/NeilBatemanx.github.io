<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which might be an inexpensive option for clients in rural areas.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send mobile phone signals with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
