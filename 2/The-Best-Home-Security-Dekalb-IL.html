<p>Although 1080p is normally the basic resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but nearly all have digital zoom, which crop and expand whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>

Frontpoint also recently added a sleek security hub that learns your daily patterns and changes accordingly. Most other security systems come with hubs, however a finding out security center is special. That type of tech is typically in wise speakers, not security centers.</p>
<p>The Canary Flex includes a smart variation that sends notifies straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera uses a wide variety of features including a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the roadway.
