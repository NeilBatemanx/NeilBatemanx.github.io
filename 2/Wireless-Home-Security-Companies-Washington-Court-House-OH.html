I've ditched my Nest Cams because they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually detected burglars or wild animals.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
