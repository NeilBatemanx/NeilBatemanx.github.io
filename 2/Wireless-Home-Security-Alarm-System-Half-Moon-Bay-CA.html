<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run inside your home or indoors - you get a lot of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for standard home security equipment and the reassurance of expert monitoring.</p>
<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is important. In truth, we do not suggest buying this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to compare a person and an automobile, for instance, enables you to minimize unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
