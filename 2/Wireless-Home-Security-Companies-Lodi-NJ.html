<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only two alternatives.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
