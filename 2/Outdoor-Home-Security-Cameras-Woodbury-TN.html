<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
