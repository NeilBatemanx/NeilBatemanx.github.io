<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today.

For the majority of homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.
