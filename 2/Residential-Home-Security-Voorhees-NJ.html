Who will hear and respond to the alarm? And so on. Less than half the protection the consumer anticipates is being supplied if that system is not monitored.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automatic zoom which tracks moving items if it identifies an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to serve as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
