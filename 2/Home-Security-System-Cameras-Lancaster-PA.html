<h3>Camera Home Security System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

Which's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly fee for a set quantity of time, typically one to five years.

Spending for the equipment up front offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
