Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
