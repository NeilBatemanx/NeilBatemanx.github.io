<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to up to 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a function offered from all companies. If this is a high priority, make sure to investigate the company's features or speak with a representative straight.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send smart device notifies with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
