It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise known as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to pair with other clever devices and can not be managed from another location. Also a local alarm won't get in touch with the authorities; it simply triggers an audible siren to inform people close by.</p>
