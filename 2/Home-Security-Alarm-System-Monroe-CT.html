<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
