We first saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
