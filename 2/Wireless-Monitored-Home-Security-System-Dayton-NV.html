<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems planned to summon authorities department workers, requires registration, assessment of fees for extreme false burglar alarms, provides procedures for repeat transgressors, and offers a reliable date. Another huge function is night vision. You may also consider a camera with a built-in motion-activated light-- all the much better to frighten you with, my dear!

<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which captures each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

Wired systems can not operate when an interruption takes place, leaving the home vulnerable.
