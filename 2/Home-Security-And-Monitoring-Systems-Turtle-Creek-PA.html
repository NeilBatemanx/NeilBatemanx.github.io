<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to advise as a top pick.</p>
<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, typically one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment in advance provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as sometimes as you desire.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
