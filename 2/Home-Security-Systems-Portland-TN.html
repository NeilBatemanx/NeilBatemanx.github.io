<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
