The clever bit is that the camera not only spots that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Possibly more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should immediately know.</p>
