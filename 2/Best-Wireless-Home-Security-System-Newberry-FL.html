<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level authorities official in Washington, DC was caught using cops databases to collect info on patrons of a gay club. By looking up the license plate numbers of parking area at the club and looking into the backgrounds of the lorries' owners, he tried to blackmail patrons who were wed.

<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security strategy, the very same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you. If you're not mechanically inclined, having actually a professional set up the system may give you more confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have everything-- enjoy things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
