<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
