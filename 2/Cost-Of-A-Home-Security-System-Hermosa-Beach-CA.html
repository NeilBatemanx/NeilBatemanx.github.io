<p>The threats to users of wireless innovation have actually increased as the service has actually ended up being more popular.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is typically done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor areas), then yes, central station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is set off. However, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is normally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, residential areas). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if requested by the customer. </p>
