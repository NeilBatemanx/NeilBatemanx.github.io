<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
