<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were bought by Google. Something all of us need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has detected intruders or wild animals.
