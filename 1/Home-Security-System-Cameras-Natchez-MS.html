<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, scams, and vandalism.

When you're at home and don't want to be taped, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets set off while you're away, you have no visual methods of confirming if something is really wrong and how severe the circumstance is.

<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
