<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

The Nest Labs Nest Cam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Increase into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it occurs, is straight linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not unique to Lennar house owners. </p>
