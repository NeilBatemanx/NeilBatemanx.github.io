The city has since embraced a new collaboration with General Electric in which street lights are equipped with cameras and microphones.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smartphone informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
