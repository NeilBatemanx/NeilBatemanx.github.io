<p>Since it's more complicated than it must be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control panel does require to be set up by a connected and expert to a power source.

'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody!
