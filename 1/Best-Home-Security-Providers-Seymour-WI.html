<p>Wi-Fi cameras aren't just for capturing a thief in the act, though. They're likewise beneficial for casual home monitoring. Placed on countertops, tables, and shelves, they permit you to watch on what your family pets are doing, know when the kids get home from school, or find who's been hitting the liquor cabinet. Most even allow you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is taking place, by means of an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
<p>The drawback to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even set off false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur often enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the reality that there are no installation costs.</p>
