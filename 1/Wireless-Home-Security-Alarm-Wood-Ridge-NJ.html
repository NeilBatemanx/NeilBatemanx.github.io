<h3>Security System Equipment Wood Ridge NJ 07075</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
