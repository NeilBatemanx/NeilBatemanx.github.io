<p>Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera isn't quite as cheap as our previous pick in this classification-- the $20 Wyze Web Cam V2-- but Xiaomi's Mi Home Security Camera is an even better value at $40. ADT's reputation and monitoring services stand out from the remainder of the pack. This is because of the company's 140 years of experience, advanced equipment and automation, and well-trained, proficient staff members.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both human beings and animals. Given that carbon monoxide is colorless and odor-free, the only way to monitor harmful levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector.

<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to ignore objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
