<p>The cover of darkness isn't enough to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between recording and finding motion.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
