<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Dependability is an extremely subjective when it comes to technology matter, depending upon which features and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more integratable and nimble, but low signal strength and poor connection are still common complaints.
