By combining LiveWatch DIY security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other big names in the industry.

Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you choose a three-year contract, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication.
