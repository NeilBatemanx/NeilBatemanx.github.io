Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and generally burdensome contracts, and typically count on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little advantage. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated independently and don't advise for many people.</p>

It's almost like an all-in-one security system, though it is course restricted in terms of just how much of your residential or commercial property its single camera (with a 125-degree field of view) can cover.</p>
<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false complacency given that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
