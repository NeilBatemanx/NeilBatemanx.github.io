<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
