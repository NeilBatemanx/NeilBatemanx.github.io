This chapter governs alarm system systems planned to summon authorities department workers, needs registration, assessment of charges for excessive false alarm system, offers procedures for repeat transgressors, and offers an effective date. ADT gives you lots of choices. You can rent a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by a number of the leading brand names.
