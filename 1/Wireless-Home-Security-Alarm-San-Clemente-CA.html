<p>Cameras often broadcast video footage online, permitting operators to monitor security camera feeds remotely. In many cases, surveillance systems are spent for and run by the cities themselves. However in other cases, services and citizens share surveillance camera video footage with law enforcement officer. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets.

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very common type of 2 piece sensing unit that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or typically closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as when it comes to proximity to the second piece which contains a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either opens or closes, again based on whether or not the design is normally open or usually closed. This action paired with an electric present (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensing units are very typical and are discovered either wired directly to an alarm control panel, or they can normally be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>

They might get past the camera before it had time to tape-record them if a nefarious lawbreaker was quickly enough.</p>
