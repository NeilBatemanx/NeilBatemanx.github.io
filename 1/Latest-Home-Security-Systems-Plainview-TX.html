<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
