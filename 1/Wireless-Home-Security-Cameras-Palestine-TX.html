<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
