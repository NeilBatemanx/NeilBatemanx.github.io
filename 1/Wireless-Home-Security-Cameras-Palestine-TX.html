The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
