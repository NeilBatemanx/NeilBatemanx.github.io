Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
