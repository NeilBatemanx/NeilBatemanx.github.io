<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

Given all of the other advantages, it's easy to see why a lot of people are choosing this option. </p>
