The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>

<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is required for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

The company sends an authorized technician with an average of 11 years experience to examine the home and install the equipment when customers buy one of ADT's security packages. Sometimes, the company has the ability to supply professional installation services the same day.</p>
