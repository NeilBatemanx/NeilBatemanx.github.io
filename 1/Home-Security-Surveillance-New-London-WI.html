<p>Moreover they can not send fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution snippets of video. Blink Security Cameras are a fine example of a system we are continuously helping consumers change. As professionals in the market our recommendations is to stay away. If you do buy them, initially inspect the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice.</p>
