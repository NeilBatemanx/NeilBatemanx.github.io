In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and regular monthly burglary and fire monitoring. The overall installation charge alone was not cheap-- several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Buy a rechargeable battery base as well and you can put the weatherproof camera throughout Wi-Fi range (it lasts as much as three months between charges). There's also a totally wireless version, but this is a different shape to the wired version and has a different series of accessories. We like that you can use heaven by ADT mobile app without any difficult fineprint or extra charges.

Post criminal activity examination is easy and catching offenders is simple for law-enforcement officers. </p>
