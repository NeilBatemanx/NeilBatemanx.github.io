Reliability has long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's often skewed by factors such as apprehension over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
