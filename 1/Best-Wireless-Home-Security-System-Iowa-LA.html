<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Since it's more complex than it ought to be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's style - surely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list. The handsome shiny black cube, magnetically attached to a brushed metal stand (mine can be found in a lovely rose-gold but you can likewise get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance between subtle and good-looking enough to not draw attention to itself.</p>

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter enables you to see precisely when a specific person reaches your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99).
