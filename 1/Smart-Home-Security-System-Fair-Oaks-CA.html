<p>However, in any circumstance where standard-definition video cameras are utilized, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines however the results are the same); they typically catch vertical and horizontal fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is generally 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
