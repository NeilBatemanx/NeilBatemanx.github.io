<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
