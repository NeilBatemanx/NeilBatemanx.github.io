<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I ultimately got into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being seen know they're being enjoyed, and you can choose to tape-record video or pictures and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
