<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it rapidly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker.
