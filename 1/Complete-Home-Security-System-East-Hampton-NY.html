<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) fave.

<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most cost-efficient monitoring plan beginning at $10.
