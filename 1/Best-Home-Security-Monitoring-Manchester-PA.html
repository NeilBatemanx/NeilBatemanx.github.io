<p>A wired security camera is powered by a cable connection, and sometimes, a wired connection may be required for recording and saving video footage.

It will tape-record clips when it sees movement (and a couple of seconds before so you get the complete view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week before they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you manage acquiring a membership, but I do not think the majority of people will need that choice.</p>

When they find motion, the alarm is set off and other security devices (such as a camera) may be activated. Motion detectors are among the most important pieces of equipment for your home security, due to the fact that they let you understand when someone is possibly in your home.

It works with Amazon Alexa, and it provides its own smart door lock, but you can't go installing many third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system.
