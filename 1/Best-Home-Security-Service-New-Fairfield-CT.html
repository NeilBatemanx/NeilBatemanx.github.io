<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and a vehicle, for instance, enables you to reduce unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a good perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
