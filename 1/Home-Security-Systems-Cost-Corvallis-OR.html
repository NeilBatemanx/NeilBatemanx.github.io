<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually through 110VAC power. </p>
