<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, included long and typically onerous contracts, and frequently count on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little advantage.

From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll likewise get an alert if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
