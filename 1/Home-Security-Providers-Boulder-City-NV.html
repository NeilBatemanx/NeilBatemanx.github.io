<p>To determine response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. A number of cities likewise require a license to even run a home and own security system.

At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to suffice to frighten burglars in most cases. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to require authorities reaction.</p>
