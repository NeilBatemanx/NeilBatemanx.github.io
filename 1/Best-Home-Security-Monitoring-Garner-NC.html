<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is extremely reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
