<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
