<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events.

If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current suggestion.</p>
