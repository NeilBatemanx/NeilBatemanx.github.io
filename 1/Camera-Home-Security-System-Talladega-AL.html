<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
