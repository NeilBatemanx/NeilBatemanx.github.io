Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by an area cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly.
