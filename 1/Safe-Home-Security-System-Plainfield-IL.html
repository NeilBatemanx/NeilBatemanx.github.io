<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick.
