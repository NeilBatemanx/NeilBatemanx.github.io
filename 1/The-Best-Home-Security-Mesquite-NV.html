<p>The wireless network seeks all restricted to a small geographical location.

Thus the exposure is low with an open wireless access point, and the risks with having an open wireless network are small. Nevertheless, one need to know that an open wireless router will give access to the local network, typically including access to file printers and shares.</p>
<p>There's no dedicated center involved here - each camera connects straight to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
