The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it connects with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as numerous third-party smart- home devices. However to really make use of the camera's functions, you'll need to pay out $10 or more per month for the Nest Aware program, which offers you access to cloud storage, individual detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly innovative, so we're truly advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower price if you choose a three-year contract, but given that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So select what will be the much better offer for you. If you know you'll stay put for a minimum of 3 years, opt for the contract and enjoy those cost savings. However if you might upgrade to a new office with various security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>

That is to state, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it comes to separating the images of an active event about to happen. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to contribute to a full Vivint home security system. </p>
