<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
