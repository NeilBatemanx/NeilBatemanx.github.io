<p>A little more pricey than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as simple to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensing units had been triggered. We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have essential fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
