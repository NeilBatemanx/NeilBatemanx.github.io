<p>To assess response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
