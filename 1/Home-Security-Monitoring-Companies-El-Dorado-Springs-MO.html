It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is very sensible, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
