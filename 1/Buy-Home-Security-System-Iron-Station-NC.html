<h2>What Does It Take To Catch A Thief With CCTV Security Cameras Iron Station</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating.
