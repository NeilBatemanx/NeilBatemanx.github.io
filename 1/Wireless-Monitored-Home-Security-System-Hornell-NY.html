(You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey general per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't suggest it considering that its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
