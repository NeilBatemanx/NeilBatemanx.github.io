<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this article, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of clever home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other smart home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely impressive, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts!

Secure America subcontracts its monitoring services to POLICE OFFICERS Monitoring, an award-winning, UL-certified company with 6 across the country monitoring stations and a 16.2-second average top priority alarm response time.
