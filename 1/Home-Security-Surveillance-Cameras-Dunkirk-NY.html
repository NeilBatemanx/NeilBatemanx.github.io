It can likewise be two-way audio, which provides not only the capability to monitor the video and audio but also a way of providing audio direction through the camera or its accessory speaker.

While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't believe that these problems modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
