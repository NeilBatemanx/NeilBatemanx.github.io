'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing watching outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the exact same person could put a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the privacy of their home.
