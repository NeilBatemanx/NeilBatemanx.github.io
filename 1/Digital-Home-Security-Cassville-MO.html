We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion.
