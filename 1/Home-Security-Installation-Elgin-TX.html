<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<h3>Camera Home Security System in Texas</h3>
