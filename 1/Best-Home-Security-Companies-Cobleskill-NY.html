<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand does not otherwise charge up front for a system it says is worth $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by 3rd parties, so what you get may be from a different maker than the equipment your next-door neighbor received. Why's that? ADT utilizes an independent distributor design including third-party dealerships. The dealerships identify which equipment to use.</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have shown invaluable for surveillance - however there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio. Humans have 5 senses that collectively permit us to properly vary our environment. For that reason, it just makes sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more reliable. And since it's not practical to engage smell, touch, and taste remotely, the most effective video surveillance systems combine sight and hearing to enhance security protection.</p>
