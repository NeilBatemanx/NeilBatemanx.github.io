Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is super reasonable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
