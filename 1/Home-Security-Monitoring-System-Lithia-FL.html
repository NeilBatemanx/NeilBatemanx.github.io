We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of approximately 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
