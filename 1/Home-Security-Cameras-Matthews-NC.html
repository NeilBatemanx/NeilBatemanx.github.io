Screens can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

<p>Home security systems have actually become an affordable amenity for each property owner, however not everyone desires a system that's monitored by a security company. Thankfully, there are many systems on the market that offer house owners the power to self-monitor, which means they can monitor their own home. A self-monitored system offers homeowners protection and assurance without the cost of a monitoring company. Since alarm technology is now mostly controlled by mobile apps that inform house owners about disruptions, professional monitoring is no longer a requirement.</p>
<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can deal with every camera. Of course, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs use IP cameras, however the compatibility question extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras only from particular makers and not others. When purchasing a video recorder, you must initially ensure that the device will deal with the cameras you have actually bought. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras need to be able to supply you with the needed info.</p>
