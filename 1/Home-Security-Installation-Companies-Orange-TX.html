On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other clever home tech to the system. It won't deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies.

<p>The most significant drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual ways of verifying if something is in fact incorrect and how serious the circumstance is.

This enables the camera or monitor to react to numerous situations, such as taking an image when your Nest Protect detects smoke, or informing your Philips Color clever bulb to switch on when unforeseen noises are detected.</p>
