<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide assailants are plainly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be attracted to the tv protection cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system may supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
