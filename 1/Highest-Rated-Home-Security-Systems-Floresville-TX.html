A lot of wireless keypads are placed by the front door, however it does not have to be.

The keypad allows you to enter your security code in case the alarm is activated while you are at home. Choose an available positioning that works for you.</p>

Why bother getting that fancy alarm system if you consistently leave the front door unlocked and have such dim lighting that a camera can't tape-record a clear image anyhow?
