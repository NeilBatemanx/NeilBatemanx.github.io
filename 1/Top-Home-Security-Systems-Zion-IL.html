With standard wise home gadgets like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and inspect that you locked your doors.

A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and do not recommend for most people.</p>

Their timeframe for action in under 10 seconds, which we need to confess is rather exceptional.
