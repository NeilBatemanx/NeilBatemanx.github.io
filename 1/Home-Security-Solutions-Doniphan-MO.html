<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for incorrect alarms, and decrease the number of unneeded cops and fire responses. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and should be teaching their consumers how to correctly set and care for their alarm. National and local stats have proven that raising fines paid straight by businesses and property owners have had no substantial effect on reducing the number of incorrect alarms. Alarm-monitoring companies have actually delighted in the benefit of police reaction to their customers' alarms without any accountability for the accuracy or reliability of those alarms.</p>

Incorrect home network configurations, flaws in the devices or password compromise could permit a hacker to break into the system and identify if anybody is home, and even seize control.

Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and short of a general power outage, are more difficult to disrupt. Regardless of a general improvement in wireless innovation, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and paralyzed. </p>
