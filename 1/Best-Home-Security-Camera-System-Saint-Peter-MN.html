In spite of that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars most of the times. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you.

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video in dark conditions.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
