On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a ton of other wise home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies.

<p>When you get a wireless self monitored alarm system, make certain to keep the base device in a central area so all the various devices remain in close distance to it. It will record clips when it sees motion (and a couple of seconds before so you get the full view of what occurred) and you can see these for a week before they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a subscription, however I do not think the majority of people will require that choice.</p>
