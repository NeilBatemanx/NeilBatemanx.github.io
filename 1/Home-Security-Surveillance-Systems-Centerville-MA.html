The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly 2 years of day, night and use images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we experienced when checking the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
