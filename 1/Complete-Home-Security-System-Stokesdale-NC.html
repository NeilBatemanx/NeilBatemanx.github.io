<h3>Home CCTV Systems Stokesdale NC 27357</h3>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
