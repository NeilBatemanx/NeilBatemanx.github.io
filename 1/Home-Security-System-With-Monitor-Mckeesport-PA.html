You can wear the pendant as a locket or bracelet, or you can clip it to your clothes.

<p>If you do come across a home invasion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm ought to be enough to scare away burglars in many cases. To recover costs and hold alarm companies responsible for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require cops reaction.</p>
