<h3>Residential Home Security in Florida</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics given that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life by far.

Paying for the equipment up front supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service.
