You get a notice in your smartphone app if your motion sensing unit is set off. There's no latency so you get notified immediately so you can take immediate actions such as triggering a loud alarm, getting in touch with the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the prospective trespassers.</p>
<p>Primarily, it's difficult to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after nearly two years of day, use and night images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion identified. We have actually seen it highlight moths, mice, and cars.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it records a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>In the end, for many clients, making the best option will boil down to the company's customer service track record and your particular equipment needs.
