In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security guard. Numerous cities also require a license to even own and operate a home security system.

High-end systems enable several access codes, and may even permit them to be utilized only once, or on specific days, or just in mix with other users' codes (i.e., accompanied). In any case, a remote monitoring center need to arrange an oral code to be supplied by an authorized individual in case of false alarms, so the monitoring center can be ensured that a further alarm response is unneeded. As with access codes, there can likewise be a hierarchy of oral codes, state, for furnace repairperson to get in the kitchen area and basement sensing unit areas but not the silver vault in the pantry. There are also systems that allow a pressure code to be entered and silence the local alarm, but still set off the remote alarm to summon the cops to a break-in.</p>
