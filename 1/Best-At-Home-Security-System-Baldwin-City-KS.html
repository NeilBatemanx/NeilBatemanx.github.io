<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
