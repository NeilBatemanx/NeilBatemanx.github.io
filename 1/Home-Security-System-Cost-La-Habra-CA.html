<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
