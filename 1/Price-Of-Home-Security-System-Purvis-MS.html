<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
