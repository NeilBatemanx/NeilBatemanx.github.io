This typically includes finding a spot for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
