<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
