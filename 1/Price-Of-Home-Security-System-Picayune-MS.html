<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do experience a home invasion emergency. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm should be enough to frighten burglars in most cases. To recoup expenses and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company must be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and supply physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to necessitate cops response.</p>

The latter enables you to see exactly when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.
