<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>

However, you might select to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any factor, even if asked for by the client. </p>
