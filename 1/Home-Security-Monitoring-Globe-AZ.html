<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal abuse.

Picture what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single interface uses additional information that might never ever have actually been possible previously, such as notice of a staff member, by name and identification number, going into the building.
