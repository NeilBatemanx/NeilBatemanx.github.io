The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually clearly tried to give it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to utilize on occasion - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have a cable television connected though, instead of working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective burglars. Definitely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
