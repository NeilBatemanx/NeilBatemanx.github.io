Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
