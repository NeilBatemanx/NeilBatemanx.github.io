<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be applied as a credit to charges due on the following month's bill from Comcast. In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used instead to any other charges due on your bill for Comcast services. You will not get a money or credit card refund of your pre-payment. Nevertheless, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise required under suitable law to reimburse the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by applicable law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any quantities due on your account (consisting of, without constraint, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, modified or not returned).</p>
