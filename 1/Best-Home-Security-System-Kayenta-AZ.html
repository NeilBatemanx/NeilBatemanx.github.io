<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dropped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all need to think of. Sirens. So your camera has discovered burglars or wild animals. Do you want to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>

Having actually a professional set up the system may provide you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically likely. Wireless cameras can't have it all-- see things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
