<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it informs the security team and, in many cases, emergency situation responders.

And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear boundaries for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a considerable danger.</p>
