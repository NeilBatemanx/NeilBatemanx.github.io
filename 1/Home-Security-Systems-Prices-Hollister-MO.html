<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to ignore items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
