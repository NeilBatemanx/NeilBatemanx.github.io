<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>We have actually examined many essential reasons why one should consider commercial-grade cameras so far, however, we have actually just skimmed the surface of the subject. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is seldom a stand-alone system. If your proposed camera system will incorporate with other products, it is worth knowing. </p>
