<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
