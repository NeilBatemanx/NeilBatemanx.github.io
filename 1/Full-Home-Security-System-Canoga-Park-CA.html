<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Dome cameras are normally used for indoor surveillance, and are typically mounted on ceilings. The camera's dome shape is created to make it difficult to tell which direction the camera is dealing with. Dome cameras feature many optional features.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are thought to be most reliable, which usually includes extremely populated towns, town hall, car parks, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).

<p>In our viewpoint, Protect America's biggest disadvantage is its three-year minimum agreement. But there's a plus side: Once you enter the agreement, Protect America offers the necessary home security equipment free of charge without extra upfront costs.

<p>You'll get current equipment from Link Interactive and a highly-rated mobile app. Unlike some other home security companies, Link Interactive provides up to 48 sensors in its basic plan, including both fire and CO alarms. If wise home security is what you seek, we recommend looking into Vivint or ADT prior to getting on the cheaper, Do It Yourself bandwagon. But if your primary objective is keeping criminals out of your house and protecting your property, you don't require to invest a package.</p>
