We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home intrusion emergency. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or perhaps 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to scare away trespassers for the most part.

<p>The Canary Flex features a smart version that sends out notifies directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera provides a wide array of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I explained it as distinctly middle of the road.
