<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
