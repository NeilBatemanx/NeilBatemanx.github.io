<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the required systems is necessary. If there are no as-built documents supplying functionality and configuration info to make this combination work, there are just two choices. The very first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is reluctant or unavailable to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to replace and rip, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
