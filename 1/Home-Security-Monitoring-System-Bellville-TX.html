<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. If your camera spots motion or noise, you can trigger a video clip or a SmartThings automation.

Or, if Arlo Pro identifies a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on. Sadly, the combination with SmartThings still has bugs and not whatever works as it should; however, the potential is still there.</p>
