<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smartphone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
