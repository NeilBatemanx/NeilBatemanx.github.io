<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 per month, which could be a budget-friendly choice for consumers in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you purchase a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that keeps track of the system will install it for you.
