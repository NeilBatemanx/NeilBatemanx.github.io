<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, comfort and fulfillment to every customer and are committed to fulfilling our customer's requirements with stability, sincerity, interest and exceptional service. Dependability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's a debate that's frequently skewed by factors such as hesitation over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and problems that cause false alarms. While improvements in the last few years have made the innovation more robust and popular (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be interfered with by other signals), concerns continue over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically don't come with upfront costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers bring into question the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or 4 free false alarms per fiscal year, since they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
