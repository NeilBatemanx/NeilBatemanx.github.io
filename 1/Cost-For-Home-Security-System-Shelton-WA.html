However suicide assaulters are plainly not hindered by camera - and may even be attracted to the television protection cameras can make sure - and the expense of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the limited advantages that the system may offer in examining attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>

<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
