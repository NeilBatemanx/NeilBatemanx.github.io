<p>In spite of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug.

We need to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
