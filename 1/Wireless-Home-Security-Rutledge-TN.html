<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
