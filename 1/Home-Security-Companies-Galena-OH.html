<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has plainly tried to offer it an appealing edge, and we need to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from approximately four cameras at a time.
