Netatmo likewise permits you to tweak the settings for each private user - for example, don't tape-record Abbie, but do record Ben. It's really pretty wise.</p>
<p>These cameras do not need a video capture card because they work utilizing a digital signal which can be saved straight to a computer system. The signal is compressed 5:1, however DVD quality can be achieved with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a somewhat lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the amount of space to be used up versus the quality of photo needed or wanted). The highest picture quality of DVD is only somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
