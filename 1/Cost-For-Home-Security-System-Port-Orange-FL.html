Cloud storage makes it easy to store and access recorded video, but it can cost numerous dollars per year depending upon your membership. Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a dedicated storage drive that provides you DVR capabilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to find a video event that occurred at a specific time.</p>
