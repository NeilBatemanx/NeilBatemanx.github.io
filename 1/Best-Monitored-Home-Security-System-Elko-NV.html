<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
