<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you're in a conference with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed vacation and your spotty cell service indicates you don't get signaled until the next day? The sound might terrify off would-be intruders-- if you're lucky if your system equipment includes an audible alarm. But the authorities will not come till you personally call them. </p>
