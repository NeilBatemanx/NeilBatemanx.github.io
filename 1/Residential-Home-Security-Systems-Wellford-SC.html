<p>Smart gadget combination: If you have a home filled with clever gadgets, think about searching for a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that includes a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can link them.

Alternately, if you do not have a home automation center, try to find a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that comes with its own mobile app. Smart locks utilize basic pre-drilled holes and are relatively easy to install. Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the inside of your door, while others require that you remove your existing interior and exterior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
