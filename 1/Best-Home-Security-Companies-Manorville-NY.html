<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>When it comes to indoor security equipment, ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors.

Frontpoint's detectors are immune to animals weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can tailor the level of sensitivity level based on your animal's size. </p>
