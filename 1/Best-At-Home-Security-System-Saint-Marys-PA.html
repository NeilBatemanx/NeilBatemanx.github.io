<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

You can extend the quantity of days you get by purchasing a membership, however I don't think most people will require that alternative.</p>
