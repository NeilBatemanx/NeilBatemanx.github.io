<p>I described that all we would require to do is take advantage of any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, might just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.
